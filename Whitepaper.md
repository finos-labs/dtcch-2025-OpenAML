## Pioneering AI-Driven Transparency and Security in On-Chain Financial Crime Detection

**An Open Initiative for a Safer Web3 Ecosystem**

---

### Abstract

OpenAML is an open-source initiative dedicated to bringing unprecedented transparency and intelligence to the detection of on-chain financial crime. As the Web3 ecosystem expands, so does the sophistication of illicit financial activities, posing significant risks to its stability and mainstream adoption. OpenAML addresses this challenge with a sophisticated Risk Analysis & Detection Engine that leverages advanced artificial intelligence, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Our platform processes vast amounts of blockchain data to identify suspicious patterns, score transaction risks, and provide actionable insights through APIs, reports, and real-time alerts. Born from a winning project at the DTCC AI Hackathon, OpenAML aims to empower financial institutions, crypto businesses, and regulatory bodies with the tools necessary to foster a safer and more trustworthy digital asset environment, aligning with FINOS's mission to accelerate open source adoption in financial services.

### 1. Introduction: The Web3 Revolution and Its Shadows

The advent of Web3 technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies, has ushered in a new era of decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital asset management. This rapidly evolving landscape offers immense opportunities for innovation, financial inclusion, and novel economic models. However, the pseudonymity, speed, and global reach of these technologies have also attracted illicit actors seeking to exploit them for activities such as money laundering, sanctions evasion, fraud, and terrorist financing.

The integrity and mainstream adoption of the Web3 ecosystem hinge on our collective ability to mitigate these risks. Traditional compliance methods often fall short in the face of the complexity and volume of on-chain transactions. A new paradigm is needed â€“ one that combines deep domain expertise with cutting-edge technology to proactively identify and neutralize financial crime. OpenAML was conceived to meet this critical need.

### 2. The Escalating Challenge of On-Chain Financial Crime

The scale of illicit financial activity in the cryptocurrency space is substantial and growing. In 2024, an estimated \$45 billion in cryptocurrency value is projected to be laundered. This follows significant volumes in previous years, with \$31 billion in 2022 (a spike due to large-scale hacks) and \$24 billion in 2023.

While the overall share of illicit transactions remains a small percentage of total crypto volume (e.g., 0.4% in 2024), the absolute laundered volume has increased due to the overall growth of the market.

Illicit funds primarily originate from activities such as sanctions evasion, scams and fraud, and stolen funds resulting from hacks, exploits, and theft. These ill-gotten gains are then laundered through increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of mixers and privacy tools, exploitation of DeFi protocols, and cash-outs through centralized exchanges (CEXs) using bogus or stolen identities. Stablecoins, due to their price stability and liquidity, have become the preferred currency for such transactions.

The maturation and broader acceptance of the Web3 ecosystem are fundamentally tied to robust regulatory compliance. Authorities worldwide are intensifying their supervision of the crypto-asset market. There is a growing demand for greater clarity in transactions and participant identification. Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT), and Know Your Transaction (KYT) standards is no longer optional but a cornerstone for the sustainability and mainstream adoption of Web3. Intelligent tools are essential to navigate this complex landscape effectively.

### 3. The OpenAML Solution: AI-Powered Risk Intelligence

OpenAML is designed to empower the Web3 community with advanced tools for detecting and mitigating on-chain financial crime. At the heart of our solution is a sophisticated Risk Analysis & Detection Engine. This engine leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze blockchain data and identify high-risk activities.

Our dual AI strategy combines the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is utilized for precise classification of transactions and risk scoring based on pre-evaluated models, while unsupervised learning is employed for anomaly detection and the identification of novel suspicious patterns. This comprehensive approach ensures that OpenAML can detect both known threats and new money laundering typologies.

The engine delivers a suite of actionable outputs, including a Score API for real-time risk assessments, compliance-ready reports, insights into financial crime trends, and real-time alerts for high-risk transactions. Our models, such as CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, demonstrate high performance with AUROC scores consistently above 0.95.

### 4. Architecture and Data Processing

OpenAML is built for scale, processing approximately one million blockchain transactions per day. Our engine ingests a diverse array of data sources, including raw on-chain data, community-contributed flagged wallet lists, stablecoin activity records, and KYC insights.

The processing pipeline follows a rigorous structure: data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, prediction, and output generation. This pipeline ensures that incoming data is transformed into reliable intelligence used to drive our detection models. Each prediction made by OpenAML is backed by robust machine learning logic and verifiable annotations.

### 5. Key Differentiators and Benefits

OpenAML stands out through its commitment to transparency, intelligence, and practical impact. Our dual-AI design allows us to both detect known threats and discover novel risks. Our open-source foundation supports community contribution and scrutiny, while our architecture is scalable enough to handle large transaction volumes across multiple blockchains.

We provide enterprise-grade services, enabling integration with existing compliance systems via APIs, real-time alerting, and automated reporting. By providing not just data, but actionable intelligence, OpenAML empowers stakeholders to act swiftly and decisively.
